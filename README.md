Test repository to practice procedures

This readme file is good practice to document the changes made after branching off from the master and the reasons for those changes.  It can be read by other contributors to explain the experiments or fixes being tested on this branch.  Once these changes have been tested and discussed, as they are described here, it may be decided that they should be merged from this branch back into master.  Whew, good process.
